# Javascript Notes

A responsive note app inspired in 'Evernote'. 

The user create an account with an authentication token generated by 'JWT' and a hashed password generated by 'bcrypt'. The user can also update 
the email and password by the same process.

About the notes, there are several ways to edit and autosave. There is also a filter that searches for the desired note.

#### <em><strong>Note: Maybe the live version doesn't work correctly due to a destabilization of Heroku when calling the api, so I'll leave the steps to run locally and also some project images.</strong></em>
